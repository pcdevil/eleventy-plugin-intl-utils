# eleventy-plugin-intl-utils
A set of internationalization utils for [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## Motivation
It's super fast to create a static website with **Eleventy** and with the help of [`eleventy-plugin-i18n`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eleventy-plugin-i18n) localization can be done with ease too.

However it only gives solution for static data and dynamic data still needs treatment during layout rendering. This plugin aims to help with a set of [filters](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/).
